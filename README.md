Hide ratings
======================================================================

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This fork is no longer maintained. Firefox releases are directly based on the [upstream](https://github.com/ganigeorgiev/hide-ratings-extension) chrome extension for the better, using the [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) tool.

Prevents you from being influenced by others by hiding the rating bars from Google Knowledge panels, IMDB, Goodreads, MyAnimeList and Letterboxd.

#### Installation

- Via [Firefox Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hide-ratings-firefox/)

- Manually (not recommended):
  1. Download the project zip.
  2. Open your browser and navigate to `about:addons`
  3. Go to extensions from the left side panel.
  4. Install `Add-on from file` from under cog at the top of the page to the right side.
